# Prosple Education Spiders
This is a repository for all of the webscrapers or spiders made to scrape course details on institutions.

These courses will be uploaded to CMS and will show on study sites like [TheUniGuide](https://theuniguide.com.au/) and [PostGradAustralia](https://postgradaustralia.com.au/).

Most of the spiders are made using the [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) framework. You can find on their website the [documentation](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/) to help you get started.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask the Prosple Data team.
